## 1. Definition

Thread is a smallest unit of CPU scheduling.



## 2. MultiThread Model

- One to one : one user thread to one kernel thread, never mutual block.
- many to one : many user thread to one kernal thread, will mutual block.
- many to many : performance very well, but it is difficult to realize.
